Song Songa, this ringing
sword is such a song
the heavier the song 
the lighter the sword

And the louder the song, 
the lighter the sword, 
the sharper the knowledge of the edge

On the battlefield
They fought for their land
And the swords of the vikings
Were shining true the night

This is the viking song
Echoes within the mountain tops
Rowing over the lake
Towards the enemyâ€™s side
